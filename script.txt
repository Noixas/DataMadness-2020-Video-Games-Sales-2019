This video was created for the data analysis class,
we will answer three questions using a videogame sales dataset
The questions are the following
 
To answer our first question we look into the total game count per genre
where action is clearly the genre with the highest amount but if we look into the genres
Platform, shooter and role playing that have less games,we can see in the following graph that
this genres have more sales than action games.

So to answer our question we looked deeper into the numbers and saw that 
a higher amount of sales in a genre means this genra is more likely to get higher ratings
while having a bigger amount of games in a genre doesnt influence the ratings

Then we proceed to our next question
Does user rating reflects more on the sales or is the critics rating?
After normalizing the data, we can see that in every genre user score is higher than critics, except in sports yet
when we look into the correlation graph we can see that the critics score correlates twice as much to the sales
hence critics ratings are more important.

For our third question.
How does the popularity of platforms change throughout the years?
First we look into the games quantities per platform, where ps2 and ds dominate the charts,
this is due to the cheaper costs of producing games for this platforms compare to newer generations
 and the high demand for more games.
Then if we see how many years a platform has lived, is obvious that PC is the oldest and how platforms 
created after the 2000s have a general life cycle of 10 years
Finally we can see the amount of games released by year per platform where generation of platforms peak 
around the same time and in every generation increases the amount of games, 
should be notice that most likely we are missing data of the newest generations, and this havent reached its peak


Base on the previous graphs, the role playing genre for both user ratings and critics

Critic score has a higher correlation to global sales than user scores

Platforms lifespan use to be shorter and nowadays they can last up to 10 years


Now we can have a quick look to the notebook and well... thank you
